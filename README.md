## Objective:

The objective of this project is to create a simple and easy-to-understand dashboard, as requested by stakeholders, that effectively displays employee performance across various metrics. The dashboard aims to provide clear insights into key performance indicators, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and foster a performance-driven culture within the organization.

## Dataset Overview

For this project, I was provided with four separate Excel files containing comprehensive data related to employees. The details of each file are as follows:

### Employee Table: 
This table includes personal details of employees such as:
 Date of Joining, 
 Name. 
 State
 City, 
 Target Call, 
 Employee ID, 
 Age,
 Other relevant personal information

### Call Table: 
This table captures information regarding the calls made by employees, including:

Employee Name, 
Number of Calls Picked, 
Date of Calls, 


### Meeting Table: 
This table records data on meetings attended by employees, detailing:

Meeting Date, 
Employee Number, 
Employee ID.

## Dashboard Explanation:

To begin with, I have incorporated slicers that allow users to filter the dataset by employee name and present insights accordingly.

Based on the selected employee, their details such as name, employee ID, joining date, state, and city are displayed through various KPIs.

Additionally, there is a section titled "Calls Count by Client ID" where we can see the total number of calls picked up by the selected employee, categorized by client. This section also shows the employee's target call count, total call count, and overall call performance.

Similarly, there is a corresponding section for meetings, displaying detailed information about the number of meetings attended by the selected employee, along with relevant performance metrics.

For a detailed understanding, please visit the live dashboard.
